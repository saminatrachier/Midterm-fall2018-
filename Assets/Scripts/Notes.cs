	//pick up the dog to look at it 
	// 'e' to confirm that is your dog
	// find 3 doggos, if you cannot find your dog in the time given, its a game over
	//if you pick up the wrong dog it flies away/despawns
	//if you find all the dogs its a win
	//side-bar with the faces of the dogs you need to find
	//(possible timer? maybe not)

	//"Hover over the dog to select, click to collect"
	//if it is the wrong doggo it vanishes into smoke
